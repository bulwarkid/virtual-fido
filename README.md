# Virtual FIDO

_Note: Virtual FIDO is currently in beta, so it should not yet be used for
security-critical products._

Virtual FIDO is a virtual USB device that implements the FIDO2/U2F protocol
(like a YubiKey) in order to support 2FA and WebAuthN.

## Features

* Support for both Windows and Linux through USB/IP (Mac support coming later)
* Connect using both U2F and FIDO2 protocols for both normal 2FA and WebAuthN
* Store credentials in an encrypted format with a passphrase
* Store credential data anywhere (example provided: a local file)
* Generic approval mechanism for credential creation and login (example
  provided: terminal based)

## How it works

Virtual FIDO creates a USB/IP server over local TCP in order to attach a
virtual USB device. This USB device then emulates the USB/CTAP protocols to
provide U2F/FIDO services to the host computer.

In the demo, credentials created by the virtual device are stored to a local
file and approvals are done using the terminal.

## Demo Usage

The demo is currently set up to run on Windows, though the demo could work on
Linux by removing the call to `usbip.exe` and running the USB/IP attachment
manually (see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP)).

Run `go run main.go start` to attach the USB device. Run `go run main.go
--help` to see more commands, namely to list or delete credentials from the
file.

Go to the [YubiKey test page][yubikey-test] in order to test WebAuthN.
